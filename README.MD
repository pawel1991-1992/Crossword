# Desktop Crossword

The purpose of this project is to create a program that can be a desktop version of a crossword that we used to know from newspapers.

## Project assumptions and ideas 

My idea of a desktop crossword consists in making simple table with size 10x15:
![Crossword_table](/github_images/Crossword_table.jpg)

One Java class handle functionality - it means integration with user, checking written headwords, fulling the whole table with given questions. That class's name is *Main.java*
Second Java class provides the whole content - questions, answers, positions of the headwords in the table etc.
That class's name is *Crossword1.java*

## Features

* Can make this and this
* Helps with some other problew
* Is awesome
